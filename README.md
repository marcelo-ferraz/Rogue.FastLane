Rogue.FastLane
==============

FastLane provides, even in an intense traffic demand, a fast reliable safe proof many-view collection that works in a similar fashion as a memory database.
Although a very primitive one, it is a very flexible and has incredibly fast inserting mechanism, even in the case of a million simultaneous inserts.

Still not finished, but very close to a first release.
